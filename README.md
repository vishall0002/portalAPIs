This project demonstrates an implementation using Node.js, Express, and the MVC architecture.

Purpose
I'm developing APIs that will be integrated into our portals. This repository serves as a simple example to understand the structure and implementation of such APIs.

How to Use
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Check the available routes in view/routes.js.

Start the Node server using the terminal/command prompt.

Use Postman (or any other API testing tool) to test the endpoints.

Dependencies
All required dependencies are listed in the package.json file.

Note: Make sure to install all dependencies using npm install before running the server. Missing packages will cause runtime errors.
